### Before You Start This Lab
Make sure that you have gone through and completed the steps involved in Lab 1.
Let the TA know if you are not signed up for this class on Piazza or if you do not have a class account (eecs151-xxx), so we can get that sorted out.

To fetch the skeleton files for this lab, `cd` to the git repository (`fpga_labs_fa21`) that you had cloned in the first lab and execute the command `git pull`.

Go through the [Verilog Primer Slides](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~eecs151/fa19/files/verilog/Verilog_Primer_Slides.pdf); you should feel somewhat comfortable with the basics of Verilog to complete this lab.
