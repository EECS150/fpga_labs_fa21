## Overview
In this lab we will:

- Extend the functionality of the square wave generator we built in lab3
  - Use the buttons to adjust the output wave frequency
- Write a Numerically Controlled Oscillator (NCO)
  - Initialize a ROM with a binary file, and use it as an LUT
  - Design a phase accumulator (PA)
- Design an FSM
  - Use buttons to switch between states
  - Use the FSM to control the sine wave
  - Test the circuit on FPGA

## Part 1: Tunable Square Wave Generator
In lab 3, we built a simple square wave generator which can emit a fixed 440Hz square wave tone. We would like to add more functionality.

### Implementation
Support 2 modes of frequency adjustment:
  - *Linear*: increase the frequency of the square wave linearly using the `STEP` parameter to determine how much to adjust the square wave period for every button press
  - *Exponential*: double or halve the frequency of the square wave for every button press (*hint*: use bitshifts)

Use the button inputs as follows:
  - `button[0]` to increase the square wave frequency
  - `button[1]` to decrease the square wave frequency
  - `button[2]` to switch between the 2 modes of frequency adjustment

Use `leds[0]` to display the frequency adjustment mode. The other `leds` can be set as you wish.

Since we now have a working button parser, we will use an explicit reset signal (`rst`) to make sure our registers don't hold undefined values (`X`) during simulation, and to gain the ability to reset our circuits at runtime.
When `rst` is high on a rising clock edge, you should reset any registers in your circuit and reset the square wave frequency to 440 Hz.

**Manually copy your DAC** from `lab3/src/dac.v` to `lab4/src/dac.v`. **Use the new `rst` signal** to reset registers inside your DAC *instead of* using initial values. Example:
```verilog
// Initial register value - Don't do this anymore
reg [4:0] counter = 0;
```

```verilog
// Explicit reset - Do this
reg [4:0] counter;
always @(posedge clk) begin
  if (rst) counter <= 0;
end
```

Use your solution from lab 3 to **implement the new square wave generator** in `src/sq_wave_gen.v`.

### Verification
**Extend the testbench** in `sim/sq_wave_gen_tb.v` to verify the reset and frequency adjustment functionality of your `sq_wave_gen`.
Make sure your RTL can handle overflow (what happens when you keep pressing the same button?)

The testbench has 2 simulation threads
  - The first one pulls samples from the `sq_wave_gen` at random intervals
  - The second one is for you **to write by simulating button presses**. You should use the `num_samples_fetched` variable to advance time in the simulation.
    - *Note*: the sample rate is `125e6 / 1024 = 122 kHz`
    - *Example*: to wait for a quarter of a second, you can use the delay statement `@(num_samples_fetched == 30517)`

You can use the same script from lab 3 to convert the simulation output to an audio file.
```shell
../scripts/audio_from_sim sim/codes.txt
play output.wav
```

### FPGA
Look at `src/z1top.v` to see how the new `sq_wave_gen` is connected.
Use `SWITCHES[1]` to turn the audio output on and off, and keep `SWITCHES[0]` low to use the `sq_wave_gen` module to drive the DAC.

Use `make impl` and `make program` to **put the circuit on the FPGA and test it**.

## Part 2: NCO
The top level schematic for the rest of this lab is shown below:

### NCO Overview
Now we can generate tunable square waves using `sq_wave_gen`. What about sine waves? A continuous time sine wave, with a frequency <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f_{sig}">, can be written as:

<p align=center>
<img height=20 src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f(t) = sin(2 \pi f_{sig} t)">
</p>

If this sine wave is sampled with sampling frequency <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f_{samp}">, the resulting stream of discrete time samples is:

<p align=center>
<img height=30 src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f[n] = sin (2 \pi f_{sig} \frac{n}{f_{samp}})">
</p>

We want to generate this stream of samples in hardware. One way to do this is to use a lookup table (LUT) and a phase accumulator (PA, just a register and an adder). Say we have a LUT that contains sampled points for one period of a sine wave with <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2^N"> entries. The entries `i` <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=0 \leq i \leq 2^N"> of this LUT are:

<p align=center>
<img height=30 src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=LUT[i] = sin(i \frac{2\pi}{2^N})">
</p>

To find the mapping of the sample n to the LUT entry i, we can equate the expressions inside <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=sin()">:

<p align=center>
<img height=40 src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i \frac{2 \pi}{2^N} = 2 \pi f_{sig} \frac{n}{f_{samp}}">
</p>
<p align=center>
<img height=60 src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i = \underbrace{\left(\frac{f_{sig}}{f_{samp}} 2^N \right)}_{\text{phase increment}} n">
</p>

This means that to compute sample `n+1`, we should take the LUT index used for sample `n` and increment the index by the **phase increment**. The phase increment (also called the **frequency control word (FCW)**).

To find the frequency resolution (the minimum frequency step) we can look at what change in <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=f_{sig}"> causes the phase increment to increase by 1:

<p align=center>
<img height=40 src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{f_{sig} %2B \Delta_{f,min}}{f_{samp}} 2^N = \frac{f_{sig}}{f_{samp}}2^N %2b 1">
</p>
<p align=center>
<img height=40 src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta_{f,min} = \frac{f_{samp}}{2^N}">
</p>

In this lab we will use `N=24`. Recall that in lab 3, our DAC has a frequency of `122kHz`, which means the frequency resolution is `0.007Hz`. We can have very precise frequency control using an NCO.

However, a <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2^{24}"> entry LUT is huge and wouldn't fit on the FPGA. So, we will keep the phase accumulator `N` (24-bits) wide, and only use the MSB `M` bits to index the sine wave LUT. This means the LUT only contains <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=2^M"> entries, where `M` can be chosen based on the required phase error. We will use `M = 8` in this lab.

### NCO Model
We’ve generated a binary file `sine.bin` for you. You can also run the following command to re-generate it:
```shell
python scripts/nco.py --sine-lut > sine.bin
```

We will use the binary file to initialize the 2D array as a ROM. You can read in a LUT binary using $readmemb():
```verilog
reg [x:0] sine_lut [y:0];
initial begin
$readmemb(“sine.bin”, sine_lut);
end
```
The ROM should be synchronous read as well.

**Write code** for the phase accumulator in nco.v. Note that the PA uses the main clock and runs at 125MHz.

**Uncomment** the modules in `z1top.v`. The nco is connected to a sampler, which simply passes the data to the DAC when it is ready for the new data.

The input of NCO comes from a random access memory (RAM). We provide a simple RAM module with 1 read port and 1 write port. Check the `fsm_ram.v` for details. Note that both read and write are synchronous. The RAM contains 4 24-bit values, which correspond to different fcws for different target frequencies. We would like to create 4 different sine waves at the following frequency:
- 440 Hz
- 494 Hz
- 523 Hz
- 587 Hz

**Calculate** the corresponding FCW and save them as the default value of RAM.

### NCO Testbench
We have provided a simple testbench for nco. To use this testbench, use the 8 LSB instead of MSB as address in the `nco.v`. Run the testbench as normal. Feel free to add more test cases. Change back to MSB when you finish this part.


## Part 3: FSM
In this part, you will implement an FSM in the fsm.v. The FSM takes the debounced button signals as inputs, and output
The FSM has 4 states: REGULAR_PLAY, REVERSE_PLAY, PAUSED, EDIT. Here is the state transition diagram:

<p align=center>
  <img height=500 src="./figs/fsm.png"/>
</p>

- The initial state should be **REGULAR_PLAY**. In this state, the audio should play the notes one by one. Each note should be played for **1 second**.
- Pressing the **play_pause button (button[0])** should transition you into the **PAUSED** state from either the REGULAR_PLAY or **REVERSE_PLAY** states. Pressing the same button while in the PAUSED state should transition the FSM to the REGULAR_PLAY state.
- In the PAUSED state, the RAM address should be held steady at its value before the transition into PAUSED and the current note should come out of the speaker continuously. After returning to the REGRLAR_PLAY state, the RAM address should begin incrementing again from where it left off and the speaker should play the tones.
- You can toggle between the REGULAR_PLAY and REVERSE_PLAY states by using the **reverse button (button[1])**. In the REVERSE_PLAY state, you should decrement the RAM address by 1 rather than increment it by 1
- **EDIT** state can only be entered when the **edit button (button[2])** is pressed in the PAUSED state. In the EDIT state, the current note should come out of the speaker continuously. Pressing button[0] will decrease the frequency of the current tune, while pressing button[1] should increase the frequency. You can decide the step at will and it doesn’t have to be linear. Pressing the edit button should transition the FSM back to the PAUSED stage.
- Hit **reset button (button[3])** should return to REGULAR_PLAY state, and all modified tunes should be reset to the original value.
- If you don't press any buttons, the FSM shouldn't transition to another state.

The LEDS[3:0] should represent the current state. We have provided some skeleton in the `fsm.v`. If you would like to use different implementations, feel free to modify it.

### FSM Testbench
**Write a testbench** for the FSM. Make sure all state transitions are tested. Use a smaller clock frequency in the testbench to perform simulation in fewer cycles.

### Put Everything Together
Check the top-level diagram again. Make sure that all modules are connected as desired. **Program the FPGA**. Plug headphones into the audio out port, press the reset button, and verify that you hear a regular play tone. Use buttons to switch between different states.
